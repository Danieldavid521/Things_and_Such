JMS APIs to interact with MQ Rabbit

The "core" part of a Spring framework is Java bean objects
AOP - aspect Object programming - enables implementation of cross cutting routines, which drastically reduce duplicate of code

minimize the code used to interact with DB

# dependencies injection

the framework creates the object for us
beanfactory is spring dependency injection framework, with XML config files

programs have multiple beans
