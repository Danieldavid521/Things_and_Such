 #Apigee
 #API keys
 each app, should get its own API key
 we have to register developers for our apps
 good idea to include api key in header vs in query
 #Apigee API proxy
 the API proxy allows us to keep our backend secure
 API proxy allows security,quotas,caching,transformations,error handling, and monitoring requests
 usually we bundle multiple API proxies into 1 API Product
 #API Intro
 proxy = HTTP endpoint
 we add policies to the api proxy, not in the backend service
 #analytics
 Analyze -> API metrics -> API proxy performance
 #monitoring
 notifications,API availbility,time to diagnose, error codes,invesitgate
 
 
# XML
XSL
Used for high end publishing
DTDXML names are casesenstive, <Para><para><pARA> are all different

Namespaces group of element and attribute names
XSLT depends on the namespaces to distringush between data and instructions for processing

Namespaces need to be declared in the document before you can use it
Xmlns: attribute is a url for the organization maintaining the namespace
Entity consists of a name and a value
Predefined character entities
XML supports unicode
External entities are linking mechanisms, the connect parts of a document that may be on another system

Unparsed entities are used to import graphics, sound files, images
CDATA
Well formed XML guarantees some minimum standards for data quality

Chapter 3 Connecting resources with Links

Simple XML resources are unidirectional

URI start with a scheme
URI uniform resource identifier

XML they are fragment identifier/HTML they are called anchors
location indpependent shceme for finding resources leminate the prolem of breaking links
FPI - Formal public identifier
heirarchical naming structure can be used to match actual structure of the document

Xpointer - special extension to a URL that allows it to reach points deep inside any XML document
XPointer can target any elemtn, unlike HTML the target is always <a>
Xlink, minimum required attribute is 'type'
XHTML comes in multiple flavors

Chapter 4 Presentation

Using stylesheets you can keep the markup pure and focused wth out polluting it with a ppearnace details

1 styleseet for hundresds of documents, this allows the document to be device independent
cascading stylesheets incoroprate multiple different sources
rule of thumb- the property from the rule with the most specific selector will win
 CSS can't create any kind of sctucture other than that of the XML source file
 XSLT
 
 Chapter 5 document model
 
 The process of formally defining a language in XML is called the document modeling
 Checkbook example
 write good comments
 DTD don't have to exist in 1 file
 
 Other formats like Microsoft Word and HTML rely so heavily on presentational properties
 that it is difficult to see structure making it almost impossible to audo adjust anything without damaging the content.
 
 XLST
 with web documents, the transoformation is performed either on the server side or the client side,
 some web servers detect a stylesheet delcaration and transform the document as it's served out
