 #API keys
 each app, should get its own API key
 we have to register developers for our apps
 good idea to include api key in header vs in query
 #Apigee API proxy
 the API proxy allows us to keep our backend secure
 API proxy allows security,quotas,caching,transformations,error handling, and monitoring requests
 usually we bundle multiple API proxies into 1 API Product
 #API Intro
 proxy = HTTP endpoint
 we add policies to the api proxy, not in the backend service
 #analytics
 Analyze -> API metrics -> API proxy performance
 #monitoring
