# Rmarkdown
* 
    * 2 types of interactive R markdown documents
        * HTML widgets framework
        * Shiny framework
    * Although HTML widgets are based on JavaScript, the syntax to create them in R is often pure R syntax.
    * You may use Shiny to run any R code that you like in response to user actions. Since web browsers cannot execute R code, Shiny interactions occur  on the server side and rely on a live R session. By comparison, HTML widgets do not require a live R session to support them, because the interactivity comes from the client side (via JavaScript in the web browser).
    * HTML widgets and Shiny elements rely on HTML and JavaScript. 
    * With the flexdashboard package, you can
        * Use R Markdown to publish a group of related data visualizations as a dashboard.
        * Embed a wide variety of components including HTML widgets, R graphics, tabular data, gauges, value boxes, and text annotations.
        * Specify row or column-based layouts (components are intelligently re-sized to fill the browser and adapted for display on mobile devices).
        * Create story boards for presenting sequences of visualizations and related commentary.
        * What about Optionally use Shiny to drive visualizations dynamically.
    * The overall rule about the dashboard layout is that a first-level section generates a page, a second-level section generates a column (or a row), and a third-level section generates a box (that contains one or more dashboard components). Below is a quick example
#shiny
shiny is multi threaded, while R is single threaded.
Nginx is the web server


shinybrain allows for snapshots of shiny code

quarto:
blog - create new project
quarto publish command for quartopub
themeing in shiny
- bslib and thematic
- thematic changes the shiny theme and the base R plots

documentation rots
some documentation comes with roles 
pasting commands for readers to use, removes typing mistakes

Class tells us the type
> class(foo)

TRUE && FALSE = FALSE
 
TRUE || FALSE = TRUE

!TRUE = FALSE

TRUE && 1 = TRUE,  boolean + any number not 0 = TRUE
TRUE && 0 = FALSE, boolean + 0 = FALSE


lang.domain <- "homework" 
toupper(lang.domain)

substr(lang.domain, 1, 4)

paste("do your", lang.domain, "!!!")


# basic flow control

if statements evaluate a boolean logical value

we can have multiple if statements

if((2+1==2) && (2*2==4)){
  print("this statement executed")}
}



if((2+1==2) && (2*2==4)){
  print("this statement executed")
} else{
 print("not here")
}


# Vectors

Vectors - an ordered collectino of values of the same atomic data type

c() - c standards for "combine"

pay attention when TRUE and FALSE, which in a vector would be logical values, but when put with characters, would be "TRUE", and "FALSE", and will be handled differently in R. Also when we use TRUE and FALSE represented as  1 and 0, or sometimes "1", and "0", we will  need to have a good understanding of how to convert elements and vectors into different types for different functions and purposes.

### subsetting/indexing

subsetting, is extract 1 or more elements from a vector. in R vectors start at index 1, and go to n. sometimes vectors can have NA values in them as well, using an index position.


our.vector <- c(8,6,7,5,3,0,9)
our.vector[length(our.vector)]

the code above, we used a function length(), in the subscript operator our.vector[]. If we subset something that doesn't exist, R will give us a "NA", NOT AVAILABLE.

# length of the vector
length(our.vector)
# indexing the 12344 element in the 9 element vector
our.vector[12344]

A super power of R is that we can use vectors to subset other vectors. Ex. extracting values of a column that match/deny another column values or any other operation.

### sequencing

seq(50,30, by=-1)
1:10

This allows us to get a consective list of elements from a vectore
our.vector[1:7]

Remember, Lots of R functions accept vectors as arguments, called vectorized functions
sum()
mean()
sd()

mean(our.vector,  na.rm = TRUE)

we can also get sums of logical vectors

sum(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE))

summing a logical vector can be a count of the values

sum(is.na())

When we use a boolean operators, we get back a vector of the same length as the one we operated on.

how many values are over an amount?

sum(our.vector > 5)

below allows us to change just an individual element in a vector

vector[is.na(vector)] <- 0 



# Files
ifelse(!dir.exists("Data"), dir.create("Data"), "Folder exists already")
file.exists("filename.extension")
list.files(recursive = TRUE)
list.files (pattern = "csv$")
