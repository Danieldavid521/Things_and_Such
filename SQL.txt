DDL creating,alter, delete tables
DML insert, update, delete
DQL select
DCL alter grant revoke

SQL notes
indexes are pointers to the original database
after creating an index, if you add,change,delete rows, you don't have to re-sort, just update the index.
you can update an index faster than re-sort a table
primary key is the fastest way to find info for a table.
PK should always be indexed per table
don't index on fields that don't differeniate records from others

better to use catalog.schema.table naming convention for easy organization
the informatiion schema holds the metadata that describes the various tables
DDL deals with the structure of the DB(create,alter,drop)
CREATE can be used for tables, schemas, views, domains and ownership and characte set
domains are constraints we can apply to column and what they only allow
you create domains after schemas
you can alter columns, not just tables
DML is what handles the data
some SQL implemtations use + others use ||
predicates are logical propositoins, ex: the student is a senior
operators in SQL used to filter rows and columns
OR,AND,NOt is logical connectives
count,max,min,sum, avg takes action that draws data rather than from a single row
when DB users attempt to perform operations on the database, the entire set of istructions is set into a transaction, so when 2 users are trying to access/change the same data, the changes are wrapped into transactions and one user will get to go first via isolation of transactions
