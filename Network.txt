HTTP requires a client/server model. web server software could be IIS, Apache, or Ngingx. http GET requests respond with a 200 OK if everything works. before we can request a webpage, a session needs to be established(TCP)

TCP - 3 way handshake, syn,synack,ack(this is NOT HTTP yet). Before TCP can  work, we need IP.before IP and work, we need a mediam to move packets, which is ethernet
