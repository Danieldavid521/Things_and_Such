# checking the checksum
shasum -a 512 apache-tomcat-10.1.18.tar.gz

the S in https in encryption, but it's actually cryptography
the browser has to understand crypto graphy proof
we've built systems around cryptography
symetric cryptography is encryption and decryption
asymtetric cryptography is hashes, not able to be decrypted
Ek(p) = c encryption with a key of k on a public text p
sign/verify operations are similar within APIs(signed with private key, verified with public key)
KDC is kuberos? why do we still need something more? because it would be a one stop shop
key management is hard, all users would need a kuberos key, not easy to recover keys, have to be online all the time, if we have more, it's not a one hack job
public key crypto is slower than private key crypto
how do we share private keys securely?
sometimes 2 parties communicate over a hash of a session key
with all the public key communication, everyone knows everyones publc keys, how can we know who's who?
Certificate authority - keys a table of public keys and private keys and their association
name | key table
CA doesn't have to be online for every transaction
CA signs the name:key table with it's secret key
CA's are offline versions of koberors
when we downlaod a web browser, or get a new laptop, they come preinstalled with already signed public keys
kuberos sessions last a few hours, CA's last a year
CRL is a list of revoked Certs, but this list is waaay too long
OCSP - ping server for current certs that are valid, but it adds latency, if this server goes down, we can't connect 
web browsers like chrome can ship their own list of certs to revoke so every updated version has new list
some messages sign hashes, rather than the long messages

we can't have unencrypted data interact with encrypted data
sometimes we get lock icons in the web browser only if everything is sent over HTTPS, or has weak crypto
https doesn't allow for redirects
how much do we have to trust our DNS when dealing with HTTPS?
// actually tells the servers to just use the same URL scheme we came from
javascript tags can be hashed to confirm where they came from
force https extensions

 3 A’s - Authentication, Authorization, Accounting 
malware - malicious software 
KDC - key distribution center
kerberos requires system times to be within 5 minutes for authorization
Active Directory is just a user DB
NTLMV2(NT Lan management) - uses HMAC-MD5 
LDAP is a protocol for querying AD, AD is a single source of object management
TLS encrypts data before it’s sent
SSO - 
Transitive trusts creates indirect relationship of trust
SAML - Security assertion markup language, XML styled allows unified identity between multiple sites, SAML has 3 users manager, ID provide, service provider

some high end computers can calculate 20 billion passwords a second

# prof mess April 2021
MAM - mobile app management, allows organizations to control what apps users can install
tokentization - a string of letter representing a debit card
pivoting - using a vulnerable device to hack other devices
sinkhole - redirects bad URLs to the good “correct” URL
VPC - virtual private cloud
AIS - automated indicator sharing
taxii & stix - syntax and format for sharing security threats with other users
a debit card pin is an example of a static code

# prof mess April 2022
tcpdump is like wireshark
 attestation - confirms hardware on a remote device(checks software updates)
obfuscating hiding document within image file
hashing - passwords securely stored in DB
federation - log in with creds from another system
eula - agreement between software provider and end user
NDA - confidentially between employee and employer
iso27701 - standard for cyber standards
SOAR - security orchestration automation response - design to make security teams more effective in responding
SALT - adding random data to a password before hashing for security - prevents attackers from using rainbow tables
SALT passwords should be the pair minimum
passwords shouldn’t be encrypted, passwords should be hashed
RTOS - real time operation system, automobiles, industrial equipment, military equipment
containerization - allows a company to wipe all their data off a device, but leave personal information on it

# prof mess March 2021
nectat - sendings at a to a specific port on a remote device, allows users to read and write to the network
multi factor characteristics? 
users unique typing style - something you exhibit
plug in ID card during login - something you have
fingerprint required for DataCenter door - something you are
cert signed by CIO - someone you know
ATM pin required for trxn - something you know
nessus - vulnerability scanner
run nessus scan in home network
mac cloning = mac spoofing
data masking - hides info b replacing with generic placeholders(*)

# prof mess July 2022
API monitoring- best security for cloud based microservice architecture
“link up” “link down” are switch logs about port interfaces
ARO - annual rate of occurrence
ALE - annualize loss expectancy
SLE - single loss expectancy
ssl stripping - is similar to man in the middle, taking away the security of ssl/tls

# prof mess May 2021
Stix and Taxii are security threat protocols for sharing information
watering hole - a central location that gets malware that affects downstream users(payment processor)
TKIP - temporal key integrity protocol, wireless(WLAN) security protocol, an alternative to WEP
ccmp - cryptography encapsulation method for data confidentiality(wpa2)
non-repudiation - proof of data integrity, genuine info with high confidence
DLP - data loss prevention

Private Browsing
What is private browsing? - acitivity of a user is indistiguible from other users
there is no definition of private brwosering
it's getting very complex now with web applications being able to use video and audio settings on devices
local attacker - takes over the machine after user leaves
Private Browsing can at time NOT write to disk, but the RAM it's using could get pushed to the swap space/page file
private browsing browsers don't try to encrypt their program in the RAM
the CPU has to process clear text instructions
after Snowden leaks, private browser modes made it more obvious they wouldn't hide you from the NSA
data lifetimes's overflows into more than just private browsing
even if we clear the application layer of RAM IO, there are multiple layers lower that that info has to pass through that hackers can recall
kernel memory is where RAM secrets can leak
overwriting by zeroing out data can slow performance
encrypt data as is goes to disk storage can help
openBSD swap encryption


Some companies like to keep their trade secrets, secrets, and that is okay
Research sometimes needs anonymity, sometimes serving different info to different users can help keep things less transparent
Police need anonymity when doing investigation
Hackers know someone is doing something online, but they don'92t know exactly what, with mathematically probability proof
If we made security systems that hackers use illegal, we would have insecure systems
There wasn'92t strong use of cryptography of the public in the early 1990'92s, but today is different
Letter, then ascii, then hex, then binary
TOR will obfuscate packet timing and size to create anonymity, we could rule that everything needs to be the same size to make it less clear
Without large users, anonymity isn'92t maximized 
TOR uses circuits where all 3 relay nodes are given a public key by Alice to tunnel traffic(relay cells)
Integrity checking
TLS key negotiation links are used in TOR
On the other end of TLS connections are TCP connections
We don'92t individiully encrypt IP packets, because different OS'92s have different IP stack specifications
 TOR just relays TCP
Guard nodes judge on bandwidth
badopsec
We are in an encryption rennisiance
Sovereign firewalls are for censorships, and block the latest TOR version, and just sell software updates
RSA 1024 was important in 2003, but not today

HTTP requires a client/server model. web server software could be IIS, Apache, or Ngingx. http GET requests respond with a 200 OK if everything works. before we can request a webpage, a session needs to be established(TCP)

TCP - 3 way handshake, syn,synack,ack(this is NOT HTTP yet). Before TCP can  work, we need IP.before IP and work, we need a mediam to move packets, which is ethernet

OSI MODEL <br>
physical  | *wires, glass, Radio Freq* <br>
data Link *Ethernet | ppp, ethernet, 802.11* <br>
network  *IP | ICMP *<br>
transport *TCP & UDP* <br>
session <br>

# tplinkusb
reinstalled the driver with this commands:

sudo apt install git dkms
git clone https://github.com/aircrack-ng/rtl8812au.git
cd rtl8812au
sudo make dkms_install
If you don't hace permission try to execute:

chmod 777 rtl8812au

network protocols
What is koberos for?
large network with server and clients(MS AD)
previous security of koberos was just signing in with IPs 
TGS Ticket Granting Service
Kerberos client key is just as good as their password
KDC does authentication, but ACL and groups provide authorization
how do ACL and Kerberos stay synced after users leave the network/company?
Koberos hashes values and then sends it with a key to confirm no tampering
SRP and PAKE protocols
Kerberos initially used DES encryption which has 56bit keys
There can be duplicate read only KDCs for redundancy

# Certificates X.509
certs are linked to an identity, and has an issuer
if you trust the issuer, you trust the cert
CA root certs are self signed
